code files of camera:

arch/arm/mach-liger/isp_pwd.c
--> common interfaces for sensor drivers used to power on/off and reset sensor, 
    and also to get sensor's config.

arch/arm/mach-liger/include/mach/gl5203_isp.h

isp/
--> isp driver on SOC

sensor/
--> drivers of sensor, only gc0308, gc2035 and gt2005 supported, others used 
    for gl5202, need migrate.
    NOTE: sensor_comm.c file should be included by each sensor driver.

driver insmod

dual camera:
if support tow sensors which are different, eg:
insmod gc0308.ko
insmod gc2035.ko
insmod gl5203_cmaera.ko

if front sensor is the same as rear one:
insmod gc0308.ko dual=1
insmod gl5203_camera.ko

you can select which one is going to work by writing /sys/dualcam/dualmod file;
should not write to it when the device is open.
read the file to get which one is valid, 1 is rear one , 0 is front one. 
only when dual==1, dualmod file is created.
when tow sensors are different, should not assign dual varible for anyone.

single camera:
insmod gc0308.ko
insmod gl5203_camera.ko

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
host and channel:
normally, only one host exist in out system, no mater 3D supported or not;
for non-3D envirement, only use a particular channel(sens0 or sens1) determined
by board type. if both are supported, select any one by isp dts.
for 3D envirement, only and should one host exist which using tow channels at
the same time.
